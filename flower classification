In this task, you will develop a model to classify Iris flowers into three species—
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. Using the classic Iris dataset, which provides measurement data for each species, your objective is to train a machine learning model capable of accurately
categorizing flowers by species. This project serves as an introductory classification
task, allowing you to explore fundamental machine learning concepts.
